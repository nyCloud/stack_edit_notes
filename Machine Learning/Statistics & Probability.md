# Statistics & Probability
## 1.Basic Probability

### Conditional Probability
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}$$

- If P(A) = P(A|B), then P(AB) = P(A)P(B), because P(A|B) = P(AB) / P(B). When P(AB) = P(A)P(B), we can say that event A and B are independent

### Law of Total Probability
Given a event A and a group of events B_i, if their probabilities are subject to:
$$	\sum_i P(B_i)  $$
